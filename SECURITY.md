## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

The easiest way to report a security issue is privately through GitHub.  See [Privately reporting a security vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) for full instructions.

Alternatively, you can report a security issue via e-mail to geostudio@ibm.com
